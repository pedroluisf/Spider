# Spider
An Hackathon project which purpose was to create a visualisation tool that showed all webpage component requests plotted into a map. 
That way we could have a glimpse of the effort it takes to serve a single web page.

Built using NodeJs express plugin for the server side, D3.js and jQuery for the frontend.
